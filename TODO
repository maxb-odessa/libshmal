version 0.2:
 -- 32/64/... bits data types: we should not depend on it
 -- off_t for internal segments offset might be good idea, but... think of it
 -- add mmap/ipc support for create/init/destroy/etc functions as a param
    and get rid of those macros (though they should remain internally)
 -- replace some "for(..., ..., i++) mem[i]=0" things with memset() or bzero() 
 -- add support for posix shmem
 -- do we really need those (de)alloc stats collecting?
 -- write shmal_realloc() and some siblings
 -- add some checks into configure.am

version 0.3:
 -- separate tables for free/used cells data?
 -- provide more mutex mechanisms then just pthread_mutex
